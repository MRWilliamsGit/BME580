# Machine Learning Analysis of Schizophrenic EEG Records
Neuroscientific literature has established the schizophrenic brain is less “organized” than a healthy brain, particularly in the occipital lobe. With this project, we will seek to replicate these findings using machine learning, and perhaps uncover more specific details regarding EEG patterns that are disrupted.

## Data
- 16 sensors were used across the brains of 84 subjects: 45 adolescents diagnosed with schizophrenic symptoms, and 39 adolescents determined to be non-symptomatic.
- EEG recording was completed for a full minute at 128 Hz.
- Data was sourced from Lomonosov Moscow State University: http://brain.bio.msu.ru/eeg_schizophrenia.htm
- Data was originally obtained and prepared by D.Sc., Prof. N.N. Gorbachevskaya (Leading Researcher at The Mental Health Research Center) and Ph.D. S.V. Borisov (Senior Researcher at Faculty of Biology M.V.Lomonosov Moscow State University).
